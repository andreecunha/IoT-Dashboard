# IoT-Dashboard: Real-Time Environmental Monitoring System

**IoT-Dashboard** is an Internet of Things (IoT) platform for collecting, transmitting, and visualizing environmental data. The system integrates MQTT for data exchange between sensors and subscribers, a web-based dashboard for visualization, and a TCP-based configuration console for managing alarms and settings.

## Project Overview

The project implements a full-stack IoT solution:
- **Data Collection:** Using sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi.
- **Data Transmission:** MQTT for real-time data transfer.
- **Visualization:** A configurable web dashboard displaying sensor data and triggering alarms based on user-defined thresholds.
- **Configuration:** A TCP-based console to adjust settings like temperature zones and thresholds for alarms.

---

## Key Features

1. **Real-Time Data Collection:**
   - Sensors for temperature, pressure, luminosity, and sound.
   - Data transmitted via MQTT to a subscriber running on a local machine.

2. **Interactive IoT Dashboard:**
   - Displays real-time data for all sensors.
   - Includes historical data visualization for the last five collected values.
   - Alarm system for exceeding predefined thresholds.

3. **Configurable Settings:**
   - Switch between two data zones (Zone1 and Zone2 for temperature).
   - Set thresholds for alarms via a TCP client-server interface.

4. **Alarm System:**
   - Automatically triggers alarms on the dashboard when thresholds are exceeded.
   - Alerts are displayed dynamically on the dedicated `alarms.html` page.

## System Architecture

1. **Sensors:** Connected to a Raspberry Pi for data collection.
2. **MQTT Publisher:** Publishes sensor data to topics specific to each group (e.g., `GroupID_temperature`).
3. **MQTT Subscriber:** Receives and processes data, updating the IoT dashboard.
4. **Dashboard:** Displays sensor data and alarms, built with HTML and preconfigured templates.
5. **TCP Console:** Adjusts configuration settings such as alarm thresholds and data zones.

## Installation Guide

Clone the repository:
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/andreecunha/IoT-Dashboard.git
   ```

1. **Set Up the Raspberry Pi:**
   - Connect sensors and ensure the `read_sensors.py` script is available.
   - Use the following command to run the script:
     ```bash
     python3 read_sensors.py
     ```

2. **Run MQTT Publisher:**
   - Execute the `publisher.py` file on the Raspberry Pi to send data:
     ```bash
     python3 publisher.py
     ```

3. **Run MQTT Subscriber:**
   - Execute the `subscriber.py` file on your local machine:
     ```bash
     python3 subscriber.py
     ```

4. **Launch the Dashboard:**
   - Start the server with:
     ```bash
     python3 server.py
     ```
   - Open the link generated by the server to view the dashboard.

5. **Configure via TCP Console:**
   - Start the server:
     ```bash
     python3 server_tcp.py
     ```
   - Connect using the client:
     ```bash
     python3 client_tcp.py
     ```

## Usage Guide

- **MQTT Topics:** Use a unique topic format (e.g., `GroupID_sensor`) to ensure correct data transmission.
- **Threshold Commands:**
  - Example: Set a temperature threshold to 30Â°C:
    ```bash
    T_TEMP_30
    ```
- **Zone Selection Commands:**
  - Switch to Zone1:
    ```bash
    Zone1
    ```
  - Switch to Zone2:
    ```bash
    Zone2
    ```
- **Dashboard Refresh:** Refresh the dashboard pages to view updated data and alarms.
