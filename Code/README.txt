In order to run this program you should:

1. Run the file "publisher.py" in the raspberry.py (publishes the data collected from the sensors)

2. Run the "subscriber.py" file located at ./subscriber.py (receives and stores the information from the sensor)

3. In order to view this data run the file "server.py" (./server.py) and click the link generated when you run it (launches the server with both html files (index and alarms))

4. Run "client_tcp.py" and "server_tcp.py" (./client_tcp.py and ./server_tcp.py) and write the commands to change the alarms and the source of the temperature values in client_tcp

Refresh the html pages to get the new data
